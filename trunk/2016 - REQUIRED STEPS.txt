As of the year 2018 the following ZIP archive must be downloaded.
This is a courtesy. dom/codeGen/gen.php can generate these files.
The reference implementation project inside of the viewer folder
is set up to find these files in dom/include/2 & 3, however user
code can place them anywhere, or use a different XML Schema file
than COLLADA's. COLLADA-DOM's library component is now a general
purpose XML container library for C++. (By using the dom/codeGen
C++ include files generator written for PHP.)
